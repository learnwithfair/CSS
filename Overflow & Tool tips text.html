                    creating this resume, think of what you want the employer to learn about you in under five
                    seconds. Look at the organization, the appearance, and the information to determine whether the
                    document you have created represents you at your best. You may use a different font besides
                    12pt Times New Roman for the body of the resume, but do not use more than two styles of
                    fontsâ€”one for headings, and one for text. You must use parallel grammatical construction for all
                    lists and bullet items.
